The First Crusade (1096â€“1099) was the first of a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The stated goal was to recapture Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

Pope Urban II launched the crusade at the Council of Clermont in 1095, where he called upon Western Christians to take up arms and reclaim the sacred lands. The response was overwhelming, leading to the mobilization of armies from across Western Europe.

Key figures included Godfrey of Bouillon, Raymond of Toulouse, Bohemond of Taranto, and others. After arduous battles and a long siege of Jerusalem, crusaders captured the city in July 1099, establishing several crusader states in the Levant.

The First Crusade was notable for its unexpected success and had a profound impact on Christian-Muslim relations for centuries.
